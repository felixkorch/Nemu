## Nemu - NES Emulator

#### The purpose for this project is mainly to learn more about the intricacies of building an emulator and the inner workings of the NES system

#### The language used is exclusively C++ except for some parts which uses javascript, the reason for this is to make it work with [Emscripten](https://emscripten.org/docs/introducing_emscripten/about_emscripten.html)

### [Test out the emulator directly in the browser](https://felixkorch.github.io/Nemu/emscripten/)

##### TODO:

- APU
- Savestates
- Better controller support
